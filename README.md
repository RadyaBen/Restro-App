<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Restro App is a web application whose main purpose is to learn how to create a full-fledged website for ordering food.
When a user opens the app, it already has a static set of products. All products on the page are clickable. Users can
add products to the shopping cart and remove them from it. They can also make an order. 
Food data is stored on a local JSON server. In case of any changes by a user, the server reloads itself and the changes are automatically saved to a
local JSON file. <br> 
The front-end part was developed with JavaScript, React, Redux, HTML, and SCSS. The back-end part was developed with JSON and Fetch API.
